    <h1> What Is Under Your Skin? - A Comic </h1>
    <h2>by Ray Marcus Persaud</h2>
    <h4>Hey! How's it going? I designed my comic using Adobe Illustrator. I was thinking about the phrase "To Get Under Somebody's Skin" which means to make somebody feel uncomfortable about something and I decided to just run with it and see where it took me. Overall, I am proud of my work. There are themes of Anti-Bullying and Self-Confidence that are apparent in the comic. Mostly I wanted it to be something fun to look at and for you to think, "What did I just read?" I really hope you enjoy it!</h4>
